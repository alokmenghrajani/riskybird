Explain what we are doing

Handle differences between various regexp implementations (e.g. php vs javascript)

Make sure parser is complete

More lint rules:

- x*x => x+
- x*x* => x*
- xx* => x+
- crazy things like \c vs \i
- escape sequences:
  \cj ==> \n
  \x0a ==> \n
  \u000a ==> \n
  etc.
  [0-9] => \d
  etc.
- empty class ranges don't match anything: []


  /\b/ matches word boundary
  /[\b]/ matches back space (\x08)
  so the identity escapes are useful in the following cases:
  - outside ranges: ^$\.*+?()[]{}|
  - inside ranges: \]-
  - haven't understood how decimal escape work:
    /[\92]/ matches '2'
    /[\12]/ doesn't match '2'

Render empty stuff (e.g. "a|" is not the same as "a")

lint rule fixer

- detect www., .com or .net and
  suggest replacing "." with "\.".
- detect \/\/ and suggest using % % as the regexp seperator
- detect error prone priority rules (e.g. ^ab|c$)

make sure when the lint rule fixer removes a group, it renumbers things:
i.e.
fix for (a)b(c)\2 should be: (?:a)b(c)\1
