Launch blocking:
1. google analytics
2. hover over character class should show an ascii map
3. anchor start-end

At some point:
- Handle differences between various regexp implementations (e.g. php vs javascript)
  - python auto anchors
  - other languages can use % % as the regexp seperator
- More lint rules:
  - x*x => x+
  - x*x* => x*
  - xx* => x+
  - [0-9] => \d
    etc.
  - is it possible to detect rules which can cause a DOS?
    .*.*foo or (.*)*


  /\b/ matches word boundary
  /[\b]/ matches back space (\x08)
  so the identity escapes are useful in the following cases:
  - outside ranges: ^$\.*+?()[]{}|
  - inside ranges: \]-

- Note:
  the spec doesn't really talk about octal escapes. We'll ignore them for now.
    /[\92]/ matches '2'
    /[\12]/ doesn't match '2'
  don't know how to handle \01, \010, etc. there is a potential
  confusion between octal & group ref?

- detect www., .com or .net and
  suggest replacing "." with "\.".
