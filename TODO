Todo:
- the parser is currently incomplete. It does not handle:
  - does not handle the ungreedy operator "x*?"
  - non capturing groups "(:?...)"
 * - the parser also incorrectly parses the following cases:
  - empty group "()"
  - incorrect ranges [z-a]
  - unbalanced stuff "((((" or "))))"
 * - lint rules
  - clean up character sets:
    - overlapping ranges "[a-mb-n]", "[a-zb-y]"
    - detect [A-z] suggested by ben
    - duplicate entires "[aa]"
    - reduce ranges "[ab-cc-d]" to "[a-d]"
- support various regexp flavors (js, php, etc.)
 * - Bugs:
  - empty true positives/true negatives get saved
  - lint rule gets rendered more than once
