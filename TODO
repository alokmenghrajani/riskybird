Explain what we are doing

Handle differences between various regexp implementations (e.g. php vs javascript)

Make sure parser is complete

More lint rules:

- x*x => x+
- x*x* => x*
- xx* => x+
- crazy things like \c vs \i

Render empty stuff (e.g. "a|" is not the same as "a")

lint rule fixer

- detect www., .com or .net and
  suggest replacing "." with "\.".
- detect \/\/ and suggest using % % as the regexp seperator
- detect error prone priority rules (e.g. ^ab|c$)
