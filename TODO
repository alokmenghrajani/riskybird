- Handle differences between various regexp implementations (e.g. php vs javascript)
- Make sure parser is complete
  - why can't it parse the crazy regexp?
- More lint rules:
  - x*x => x+
  - x*x* => x*
  - xx* => x+
  - crazy things like \c vs \i
  - escape sequences:
    \cj ==> \n
    \x0a ==> \n
    \u000a ==> \n
    etc.
    [0-9] => \d
    etc.
  - empty class ranges don't match anything: []

  /\b/ matches word boundary
  /[\b]/ matches back space (\x08)
  so the identity escapes are useful in the following cases:
  - outside ranges: ^$\.*+?()[]{}|
  - inside ranges: \]-
  - haven't understood how decimal escape work:
    /[\92]/ matches '2'
    /[\12]/ doesn't match '2'

- Render empty stuff (e.g. "a|" is not the same as "a")

- lint rule engine fixer: improve things
- lint rule engine comment code

- detect www., .com or .net and
  suggest replacing "." with "\.".
- detect \/\/ and suggest using % % as the regexp seperator
- detect error prone priority rules (e.g. ^ab|c$)
